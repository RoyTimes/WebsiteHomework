	<p>I am a high school student from China. I chose <span class = "Stanford">Stanford</span>  for my summer college school because I really like <span class = "Stanford">Stanford</span> . Hope I could get into <span class = "Stanford">Stanford</span>  some day. I am interested in computer programming and was a team member of my high school for the National Olympic of Information of China. I know how to code in C++ and Java a lot.</p>

	<p>I have learned something about HTML, CCS and JavaScript on a YouTube tutorial. Always want a chance to learn clinet side website development systematically! In general, I am really excited that I got into this class and really look forward to learn cool skills about HTML CSS and Javascript. Hope I could have great fun in this class!</p>

	<p>I am a great fan of SublimeText3. I had explored this text edit tool for a really long time and had great fun wrote my own setup files including a compiler config file. </p>
